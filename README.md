## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside this Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
├── public/                # Static assets that will _not_ be processed by Astro
├── src/
│   ├── assets/            # Images that will be optimized by Astro
│   ├── components/        # Shared components that override Starlight's default components
│   ├── content/           # All the content for the site
│   ├── fonts/             # Fonts used throughout the site
│   ├── styles/global.css  # Tailwind theme configuration and startlight style overrides
│   ├── content.config.ts  # Configuration for content collections
│   └── route-data.ts      # Middleware for injecting metadata into site routes
├── astro.config.mjs       # Astro configuration
├── package.json           # Dependencies
└── tsconfig.json          # TypeScript configuration
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
