# Gram Docs

[![Built with Starlight](https://astro.badg.es/v2/built-with-starlight/tiny.svg)](https://starlight.astro.build)

This repository contains the documentation for the [Gram](https://app.getgram.ai) app.

To run

```
cp .env-example .env
npm i
npm run dev
```

Now you can visit the project locally at <http://localhost:4321>.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside this Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ public/                # Static assets that will _not_ be processed by Astro
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/            # Images that will be optimized by Astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/        # Shared components that override Starlight's default components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/           # All the content for the site
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ fonts/             # Fonts used throughout the site
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/             # Additional pages or special paths to be added to the site
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ styles/global.css  # Tailwind theme configuration and startlight style overrides
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content.config.ts  # Configuration for content collections
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ route-data.ts      # Middleware for injecting metadata into site routes
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs       # Astro configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json           # Dependencies
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json          # TypeScript configuration
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |

| `pnpm dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `pnpm build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
