The Model Context Protocol (MCP) connects your AI assistants to real-world tools and data sources. Instead of manually copying and pasting information between tools and your AI assistant, your AI assistant can interact directly with APIs, databases, and services through standardized tool calls.

[Gram](https://getgram.ai) makes setting up MCP servers simple by hosting servers in the cloud, so you don't need to handle local configurations, manage infrastructure, or deal with authentication complexity. With Gram, you can turn any OpenAPI document into a fully functional MCP server in minutes.

This guide shows you how to create a Gram-hosted MCP server and use it across some of the most popular IDE-based MCP clients.

Find the full code and OpenAPI document in the [Push Advisor API repository](https://github.com/ritza-co/gram-examples/tree/main/push-advisor-api).

## Prerequisites

To follow this guide, you'll need:

- A [Gram account](https://app.getgram.ai).
- An MCP client. This guide covers Cursor, VS Code with Copilot, Windsurf, and Amp. For Claude Desktop, see the [dedicated Claude Desktop guide](/clients/using-claude-desktop-with-gram-mcp-server).

## Creating a Gram-hosted MCP server

If you already have a Gram-hosted MCP server configured, you can skip to the relevant section on adding it to your MCP client. For an in-depth guide on how Gram works and more details on how to create a Gram-hosted MCP server, check out the [Gram concepts guide](/blog/gram-concepts).

### Setting up a Gram project

In the [Gram dashboard](https://app.getgram.ai), click **New Project** to start the guided setup flow for creating a toolset and MCP server.

![Screenshot of the Gram dashboard showing the New Project link](/img/guides/mcp-installing-ide/gram-new-project.png)

Enter a project name and click **Submit**.

Gram will then guide you through the following steps.

#### Step 1: Upload the OpenAPI document

Upload the [Push Advisor OpenAPI document](https://github.com/ritza-co/gram-examples/blob/main/push-advisor-api/openapi.yaml), enter the name of your API, and click **Continue**.

![Screenshot of the upload your OpenAPI spec dialog](/img/guides/mcp-installing-ide/upload-openapi-spec.png)

#### Step 2: Create a toolset

Give your toolset a name (for example, "Push Advisor") and click **Continue**.

![Screenshot of the create toolset dialog](/img/guides/mcp-installing-ide/create-toolset.png)

Notice that the names of the tools that will be generated from your OpenAPI document are displayed in this dialog.

#### Step 3: Configure MCP

Enter a URL slug for the MCP server and click **Continue**.

![Screenshot of the configure MCP dialog](/img/guides/mcp-installing-ide/configure-mcp.png)

Gram will create the toolset from the OpenAPI document.

Click **Toolsets** in the sidebar to view the Push Advisor toolset.

![Screenshot of the Gram dashboard showing the Push Advisor toolset](/img/guides/mcp-installing-ide/toolset-created.png)

### Configuring environment variables

[Environments](/concepts/environments) store API keys and configuration separate from your toolset logic.

In the **Environments** tab, click the "Default" environment. Click **Edit** and then **Fill for Toolset**. Select the **Push Advisor** toolset and click **Fill Variables** to automatically populate the required variables.

![Screenshot showing the fill for toolset dialog to automatically populate required variables](/img/guides/mcp-installing-ide/fill-env-vars-toolset.png)

The Push Advisor API is hosted at `canpushtoprod.abdulbaaridavids04.workers.dev`, so set the `<API_name>_SERVER_URL` environment variable to `https://canpushtoprod.abdulbaaridavids04.workers.dev`. Click **Update** and then **Save**.

![Screenshot showing setting the server URL environment variable](/img/guides/mcp-installing-ide/set-server-url.png)

### Publishing an MCP server

Let's make the toolset available as an MCP server.

Go to the **MCP** tab, find the Push Advisor toolset, and click **Edit**.

On the **MCP Details** page, tick the **Public** checkbox and click **Save**.

![Screenshot of the MCP details page](/img/guides/mcp-installing-ide/mcp-details.png)

Scroll down to the **MCP Config** section and copy the **Public Server** configuration.

![Screenshot showing the MCP server config dialog for the Push Advisor toolset](/img/guides/mcp-installing-ide/copy-mcp-config.png)

The configuration will look something like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "GramPushadvisor": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
          "mcp-remote",
          "https://app.getgram.ai/mcp/canipushtoprod"
        ]
    }
  }
}
```

Use the **Authenticated Server** configuration if you want to use the MCP server in a private environment.

You'll need an API key to use an authenticated server. [Generate an API key](/concepts/api-keys) in the **Settings** tab and copy it to the `GRAM_KEY` environment variable in place of `<your-key-here>`.

The authenticated server configuration looks something like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "GramPushadvisor": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://app.getgram.ai/mcp/canipushtoprod",
        "--header",
        "Authorization: ${GRAM_KEY}"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GRAM_KEY": "Bearer <your-key-here>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Here's what these configuration options do:

- `"command"` – The executable to run (in this case, `npx`).
- `"args"` – Array of command-line arguments.
- `"env"` – Environment variables for the server process (optional).
- `"timeout"` – Request timeout in milliseconds (optional, defaults to `600,000ms`).
- `"trust"` – When `true`, bypasses all tool call confirmations (optional, defaults to `false`).

These configurations will work across all MCP clients. Next, we'll show you how to add MCP server configurations to the most popular IDE-based MCP clients.

## Adding the Gram-hosted MCP server to Cursor

Cursor's built-in configuration interface makes it easy to add and manage MCP servers directly from settings.

Paste in the URL of your hosted MCP server and enter the server name. The server name is used as the server ID in the MCP configuration.

![Screenshot showing pasting the MCP server URL](/img/guides/mcp-installing-ide/vscode-paste-mcp-url.png)

Your MCP server will now show up in the list of MCP servers in the `settings.json` file.

![Screenshot showing the VS Code settings.json file with MCP server configuration](/img/guides/mcp-installing-ide/vscode-settings-json.png)

### Step 2: (Optional) Add an API key to the VS Code settings file

If you're using an **authenticated server**, you can add an API key to the `settings.json` file:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "GramPushadvisor": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://app.getgram.ai/mcp/canipushtoprod",
        "--header",
        "Authorization: ${input:gram_token}"
      ]
    }
  },
  "inputs": [
    {
      "type": "promptString",
      "id": "gram_token",
      "description": "Gram API Token",
      "password": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 3: Start the server

Open the command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P`) and type `MCP: List Servers` to see available servers. Click on the Gram-hosted MCP server to start it.

### Step 4: Use the MCP server tools with Copilot

The Push Advisor tools are now available in the Copilot chat interface. You can enable and disable specific tools as needed.

If you're using a public server:

- **Arguments:** `mcp-remote https://app.getgram.ai/mcp/canipushtoprod` 

If you're using an authenticated server:

- **Arguments:** `mcp-remote https://app.getgram.ai/mcp/canipushtoprod --header "Authorization: ${GRAM_KEY}"`
- **Environment Variables:** `GRAM_KEY=your-api-key-here` (replace `your-api-key-here` with your Gram API key from the dashboard)

Find instructions for generating an API key in the [publishing an MCP server](#publishing-an-mcp-server) section.

![Screenshot showing the Amp MCP server configuration interface](/img/guides/mcp-installing-ide/amp-mcp-server-config.png)

### Step 3: Use the MCP server tools

Amp automatically loads your Gram-hosted MCP server. You can now interact with the Push Advisor API through natural language prompts like:

```
Check if the deployment vibes are good today
```

![Screenshot showing Amp successfully calling the deployment vibes check](/img/guides/mcp-installing-ide/amp-deployment-vibes.png)

## Adding the Gram-hosted MCP server to Amp CLI

Amp can be configured through the `settings.json` file.

### Step 1: Access the Amp CLI configuration file

The location of the Amp CLI configuration file varies by operating system:

- **macOS:** `~/.config/amp/settings.json`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\amp\settings.json`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/amp/settings.json`

### Step 2: Add the MCP server configuration

Add the `amp.mcpServers` setting with your Gram-hosted MCP server details to the configuration file:

```json
{
  "amp.mcpServers": {
    "GramPushadvisor": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://app.getgram.ai/mcp/canipushtoprod"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

![Screenshot showing the Amp CLI settings configuration](/img/guides/mcp-installing-ide/amp-cli-settings.png)

If you're using an authenticated server, include the environment variable:

```json
{
  "amp.mcpServers": {
    "GramPushadvisor": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://app.getgram.ai/mcp/canipushtoprod",
        "--header",
        "Authorization: ${GRAM_KEY}"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GRAM_KEY": "Bearer your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Use the MCP server tools

Amp automatically loads your Gram-hosted MCP server. You can now interact with the Push Advisor API using natural language prompts like:

```
Check if the deployment vibes are good today
```

![Screenshot showing Amp CLI successfully calling the deployment vibes check](/img/guides/mcp-installing-ide/amp-cli-showcase.png)

Amp recommends being selective with MCP tools for best performance. Too many available tools can reduce model performance, so consider disabling unused MCP tools by adding them to the `amp.tools.disable` setting.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues and solutions:

### Server not connecting

If your MCP client can't connect to the Gram server:

- Verify the MCP server URL is correct in your configuration.
- Check that the API behind the MCP server is reachable from your machine.
- Ensure the `npx` command is available (reinstall Node.js if needed).
- Try restarting your MCP client after making configuration changes.

### Authentication errors

If you're using an authenticated server and getting authentication errors:

- Verify your Gram API key in the dashboard under **Settings > API Keys**.
- Ensure the API key is correctly formatted with the `Bearer ` prefix.

### Tools not appearing

If the tools aren't showing up in your MCP client:

- Test the MCP server in the **Gram Playground** first to ensure it's working.
- Check that the toolset includes the tools you expect to use.
- Verify the environment is correctly configured with the required variables.
- Look for any error messages in your MCP client's logs.
