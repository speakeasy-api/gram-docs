Roo Code is a [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RooVeterinaryInc.roo-cline) that embeds autonomous coding agents directly in your editor. Once installed, the extension has full read-write access to your open workspace, letting you chat with the agent, generate code, run tests, and refactor files within your editor.

When paired with [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers, you can connect Roo Code to your APIs, databases, and infrastructure services, granting it contextual access to your tools and data.

This guide will show you how to connect Roo Code to a [Gram-hosted MCP server](/blog/the-easiest-way-to-host-mcp-servers) using the example Push Advisor API from the [Gram concepts guide](/blog/gram-concepts). You'll learn how to set up the connection, test it, and use natural language to perform vibe checks before you vibe code.

Find the full code and OpenAPI document in the [Push Advisor API repository](https://github.com/ritza-co/gram-examples/tree/main/push-advisor-api).

## Prerequisites

You'll need:

- A [Gram account](https://getgram.ai).
- A [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor or any other VS Code fork such as [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) or [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/).
- The [Roo Code VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RooVeterinaryInc.roo-cline) installed.
- An API key from an LLM provider supported by Roo Code (such as Anthropic or OpenAI).

## Creating a Gram MCP server

If you already have a Gram MCP server configured, you can skip to [connecting Roo Code to your Gram-hosted MCP server](#connecting-roo-code-to-your-gram-hosted-mcp-server). For an in-depth guide to how Gram works and more details on creating a Gram-hosted MCP server, check out the [Gram concepts guide](/blog/gram-concepts).

### Setting up a Gram project

In the [Gram dashboard](https://getgram.ai), click **New Project** to start the guided setup flow for creating a toolset and MCP server.

![Screenshot of the Gram dashboard showing the New Project link](/img/guides/mcp-installing-roo-code/gram-new-project.png)

Enter a project name and click **Submit**.

Gram will then guide you through the following steps.

#### Step 1: Upload the OpenAPI document

Upload the [Push Advisor OpenAPI document](https://github.com/ritza-co/gram-examples/blob/main/push-advisor-api/openapi.yaml), enter the name of your API, and click **Continue**.

![Screenshot of the upload your OpenAPI spec dialog](/img/guides/mcp-installing-roo-code/upload-openapi-spec.png)

#### Step 2: Create a toolset

Give your toolset a name (for example, "Push Advisor") and click **Continue**.

![Screenshot of the create toolset dialog](/img/guides/mcp-installing-roo-code/create-toolset.png)

Notice that the names of the tools that will be generated from your OpenAPI document are displayed in this dialog.

#### Step 3: Configure MCP

Enter a URL slug for the MCP server and click **Continue**.

![Screenshot of the configure MCP dialog](/img/guides/mcp-installing-roo-code/configure-mcp.png)

Gram will create the toolset from the OpenAPI document.

Click **Toolsets** in the sidebar to view the Push Advisor toolset.

![Screenshot of the Gram dashboard showing the Push Advisor toolset](/img/guides/mcp-installing-roo-code/toolset-created.png)

### Configuring environment variables

[Environments](/concepts/environments) store API keys and configuration separate from your toolset logic.

In the **Environments** tab, click the "Default" environment. Click **Edit** and then **Fill for Toolset**. Select the **Push Advisor** toolset and click **Fill Variables** to automatically populate the required variables.

![Screenshot showing the fill for toolset dialog to automatically populate required variables](/img/guides/mcp-installing-roo-code/fill-env-vars-toolset.png)

The Push Advisor API is hosted at `canpushtoprod.abdulbaaridavids04.workers.dev`, so set the `<API_name>_SERVER_URL` environment variable to `https://canpushtoprod.abdulbaaridavids04.workers.dev`. Click **Update** and then **Save**.

![Screenshot showing setting the server URL environment variable](/img/guides/mcp-installing-roo-code/set-server-url.png)

### Publishing an MCP server

Let's make the toolset available as an MCP server.

Go to the **MCP** tab, find the Push Advisor toolset, and click **Edit**.

On the **MCP Details** page, tick the **Public** checkbox and click **Save**.

![Screenshot of the MCP details page](/img/guides/mcp-installing-roo-code/mcp-details.png)

Scroll down to the **MCP Config** section and copy the **Public Server** configuration.

![Screenshot showing the MCP server config dialog for the Push Advisor toolset](/img/guides/mcp-installing-roo-code/copy-mcp-config.png)

The configuration will look something like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "GramPushadvisor": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
          "mcp-remote",
          "https://app.getgram.ai/mcp/canipushtoprod"
        ]
    }
  }
}
```

Use the **Authenticated Server** configuration if you want to use the MCP server in a private environment.

You'll need an API key to use an authenticated server. [Generate an API key](/concepts/api-keys) in the **Settings** tab and copy it to the `GRAM_KEY` environment variable in place of `<your-key-here>`.

The authenticated server configuration looks something like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "GramPushadvisor": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://app.getgram.ai/mcp/canipushtoprod",
        "--header",
        "Authorization: ${GRAM_KEY}"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GRAM_KEY": "Bearer <your-key-here>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Here's what these configuration options do:

- `"command"` – The executable to run (in this case, `npx`).
- `"args"` – Array of command-line arguments.
- `"env"` – Environment variables for the server process (optional).
- `"timeout"` – Request timeout in milliseconds (optional, defaults to `600,000ms`).
- `"trust"` – When `true`, bypasses all tool call confirmations (optional, defaults to `false`).

## Connecting Roo Code to your Gram-hosted MCP server

Now we'll connect Roo Code to your newly created MCP server.

Roo Code uses an `mcp_settings.json` configuration file to manage MCP servers.

To add a server to Roo Code, click the **Server** icon at the top right of the Roo Code window.

![Screenshot showing the Roo Code Edit Global MCP button](/img/guides/mcp-installing-roo-code/roo-code-mcp-button.png)

Click **Edit Global MCP** to open Roo Code's global MCP server `mcp_settings.json` file.

![Screenshot showing the Roo Code MCP server mcp_settings.json file](/img/guides/mcp-installing-roo-code/roo-code-settings-paste.png)

If you're using a public server, add the following to the `mcp_settings.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "GramPushadvisor": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
          "mcp-remote",
          "https://app.getgram.ai/mcp/canipushtoprod"
        ]
    }
  }
}
```

If you're using an authenticated server, add the following:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "GramPushadvisor": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://app.getgram.ai/mcp/canipushtoprod",
        "--header",
        "Authorization: ${GRAM_KEY}"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GRAM_KEY": "Bearer <your-key-here>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Save the file, and your MCP server should show up in the Roo Code MCP server list.

## Testing the connection

Now test the connection by running a vibe check.

Ask Roo Code a basic question like, "What's the vibe today?"

<video width="600" controls>
  <source src="/videos/roo-code-vibe-check.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

Roo Code will use the `vibe_check` tool to check the current day. Before making the API call, it will ask for your permission to use the tool:

![Screenshot showing Roo Code asking for permission to use the tool](/img/guides/mcp-installing-roo-code/roo-code-tool-permission.png)

You can approve the tool call once or select **Auto-approve** to always allow this tool and skip future confirmation prompts. Once approved, Roo Code will make the API call and respond with the vibe check results.

## Troubleshooting

Let's go through some common issues and how to fix them.

### Server not found

If Roo Code can't find your server:

- Check that the `mcp_settings.json` file is correct and matches the configuration from Gram.
- Verify that the MCP server is listed in Roo Code's server configuration panel.
- Ensure the `npx` command is available (reinstall Node.js if needed).
- Try restarting Roo Code after making configuration changes.

### Connection issues

If you're having trouble connecting to the MCP server:

- Verify the MCP server URL is correct in your configuration.
- Check that the API behind the MCP server is reachable from your machine.
- Try restarting Roo Code after making configuration changes.

### Authentication errors

If you're using an authenticated server and getting authentication errors:

- Verify your Gram API key in the dashboard under **Settings > API Keys**.
- Ensure the API key is correctly formatted with the `Bearer ` prefix.
- Check that the `GRAM_KEY` environment variable is properly set in your configuration.

### Tools not appearing

If the tools aren't showing up in Roo Code:

- Test the MCP server in the **Gram Playground** first to ensure it's working.
- Check that the toolset includes the tools you expect to use.
- Verify the environment is correctly configured with the required variables.
- Look for any error messages in Roo Code's output panel or logs.
