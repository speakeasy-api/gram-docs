Once a toolset has been curated, it's ready to be tested in Gram's LLM playground.

## LLM playground

Under the **Create** section, click the **Playground** button on the newly created toolset.

In the Playground, you can chat with the agent, deploy an MCP server, or access configuration details.

You can also set environment variables to test the toolset.

You can chat with your toolset using the chat feature. Gram has a model selector that allows you to select the model you want to use for the chat.
