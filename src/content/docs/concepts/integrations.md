Gram lets you turn your API into tools that LLMs and agents can use effectively. Beyond your own API, you can also tap into a growing ecosystem of third-party tools managed by Gram through integrations.

Enabling an integration in your Gram project adds a new set of tools that can be combined with your own to solve more complex, multi-system workflows. For example, you can enable the GitHub integration to interact with GitHub repositories, issues, and pull requests from Gram Playground, agents, or MCP clients like Claude Desktop or Cursor AI.
