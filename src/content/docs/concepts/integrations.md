Gram turns your API into tools that LLMs and agents can use effectively. Gram integrations also allow you to tap into a growing ecosystem of third-party tools.

Each integration enabled in your Gram project adds a new set of tools that can be combined with your own to support more complex, multi-system workflows. For example, enable the GitHub integration to interact with GitHub repositories, issues, and pull requests from Gram Playground, agents, or MCP clients like Claude and Cursor.
