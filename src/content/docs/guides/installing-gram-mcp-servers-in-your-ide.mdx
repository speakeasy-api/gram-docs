The Model Context Protocol (MCP) connects your AI assistants to real-world tools and data sources. Instead of manually copying and pasting information between tools and your AI assistant, MCP lets your AI assistant interact directly with APIs, databases, and services through standardized tool calls.

While most MCP server setups require complex local configurations, [Gram](https://getgram.ai) simplifies this by hosting MCP servers in the cloud. You can turn any OpenAPI document into a fully functional MCP server in minutes, without managing infrastructure or dealing with authentication complexity.

In this guide, we'll show you how to create a Gram-hosted MCP server and connect it to your IDE AI assistant. You'll learn how to set up the server, configure it, and use it across some of the most popular IDE-based AI assistants.

## What you'll build

We'll create a Gram-hosted MCP server built around the **Push Advisor API**, a simple "vibe check" service that tells you whether it's safe to push code to production based on the day of the week.

This setup enables asking your IDE's AI assistant whether the vibes are good to push code to production, with the assistant automatically calling the appropriate API endpoints through the MCP server.

You can find the full code for the example API as well as the OpenAPI document in the [example repository](https://github.com/ritza-co/gram-examples/tree/main/push-advisor-api).

## Prerequisites

Before starting, you'll need:

- **A Gram account** - Sign up at [getgram.ai](https://getgram.ai)
- **An IDE that supports MCP** - We'll cover Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code with Copilot, and other popular options

## Creating a Gram MCP server

First, let's create the MCP server in Gram. If you already have a Gram MCP server configured, you can skip to [Part 2](#part-2-connecting-to-your-ide).

For an in-depth guide on how Gram works and its core concepts, check out the [Gram concepts guide](/blog/gram-concepts).

### Step 1: Creating tools

The Push Advisor API is a simple deployment decision service that tells you whether "the vibes are good" to push code based on the day of the week. It's hosted at `canpushtoprod.abdulbaaridavids04.workers.dev` and includes endpoints like `/vibe-check` for deployment vibes.

A [**tool**](/concepts/tool-definitions) in Gram represents a single callable API action. You can create tools by uploading an OpenAPI document or selecting from pre-built integrations.

1. Log in to the [Gram dashboard](https://getgram.ai)
2. Go to the **Home** tab and click **New OpenAPI Source**
3. Upload the [Push Advisor OpenAPI document](https://github.com/ritza-co/gram-examples/blob/main/push-advisor-api/openapi.yaml)
4. Give it a name and an MCP server slug for the MCP server you'll create later

Your Push Advisor [**Toolset**](/concepts/toolsets) will be created automatically. You can find it in the **Toolsets** tab.

![Push Advisor Toolset](/img/guides/toolset-created.png)

### Step 2: Configuring environment variables

[**Environments**](/concepts/environments) store API keys and configuration separate from your toolset logic. This separation is crucial for managing different deployment contexts, multi-tenant APIs, or team-specific credentials.

1. Go to the **Environments** tab and click the "Default" environment
2. Click **Fill for toolset** and select your "Push Advisor" toolset to automatically populate the required variables
3. Set the `OPENAPI_SERVER_URL` to `https://canpushtoprod.abdulbaaridavids04.workers.dev`
4. Click **Save**

![Fill environment variables](/img/guides/fill-env-vars-toolset.png)

![Set server URL](/img/guides/set-server-url.png)

### Step 3: Publishing your MCP server

Now let's make the toolset available as an MCP server that you can connect to from any IDE.

1. Go to the **MCP** tab
2. Find the "Push Advisor" toolset and click **Edit**
3. On the MCP Details page, tick the **Public** checkbox and click **Save**

![MCP Details](/img/guides/mcp-details.png)

4. Scroll down to the **MCP Config** section and copy the Public Server configuration

![Push Advisor MCP Server](/img/guides/copy-mcp-config.png)

The configuration will look something like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "GramPushadvisor": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
          "mcp-remote",
          "https://app.getgram.ai/mcp/canipushtoprod"
        ]
    }
  }
}
```

:::tip[Tip]
Alternatively, you can use the Authenticated Server configuration. This is useful if you want to use the MCP server in a private environment. You'll need to generate an API key in the **Settings** tab and use it in the MCP Config.
:::

Your Gram MCP server is now ready! In the next part, we'll connect it to your IDE.

## Installing MCP Servers in your IDE

Now that you have a Gram-hosted MCP server, let's connect it to your IDE's AI assistant. Most IDEs support MCP through configuration files that specify which servers to connect to and how to authenticate with them.

The configuration you copied from Gram in Step 3 will work across all MCP-compatible clients. We'll show you how to add it to the most popular IDE-based AI assistants.

### How to install MCP Servers in Claude Desktop

   Amp recommends being selective with MCP tools for best performance. Too many available tools can reduce model performance, so consider disabling unused MCP tools by adding them to the `amp.tools.disable` setting.
   :::

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues and solutions:

### Server not connecting

If your IDE can't connect to the Gram server:

- Verify the MCP server URL is correct in your configuration
- Check that the API behind the MCP server is reachable from your machine
- Ensure the `npx` command is available (reinstall Node.js if needed)
- Try restarting your IDE after making configuration changes

### Authentication errors

If you're using an authenticated server and getting authentication errors:

- Verify your Gram API key in the dashboard under **Settings > API Keys**
- Ensure the API key is correctly formatted with the `Bearer ` prefix

### Tools not appearing

If the tools aren't showing up in your IDE:

- Test the MCP server in the **Gram Playground** first to ensure it's working
- Check that the toolset includes the tools you expect to use
- Verify the environment is correctly configured with required variables
- Look for any error messages in your IDE's developer console or logs
